# graph-traversal-nations

Inspired by the [Countries By Borders](https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/91108/countries-by-borders-in-90-seconds) game. Essentially the [vertex cover problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_cover), where we grapple with the issue of finding out the minimum number of nodes in order to "cover" the entire graph. That is, hit all edges. 

By itself, this is just an NP complete problem. But consider, what if we factor in "typing" speed between each countries name, or cheapest flight time (or maybe shortest), how does this problem change?
